# Family Weight Tracker
### For families to become healthier together!

The goal of this program is to help family members track 
and compare their progress of weight loss! While creating this app,
my main focus will be simplicity and user experience. This is 
because at its core, weight tracking can be achieved only using pen and paper. 
No need to overcomplicate the process and let the user incorporate
the app as seamlessly as possibly into their weight loss journey!

**Some of its features are:**

- Individual control of one's data
- Easy access and view of progress between family members

The developer of this program (Bryan!) made this to help 
his own family members lose weight and live healthier and happier
lives! It is mainly targeted towards groups of people
who will be living together, but it can also be used by individuals
as well!

### User Stories

- As a user, I want to create and add members to my family
- As a user, I want to remove certain members from the family
- As a user, I want to view the record of a family member's weight log
- As a user, I want to add weight log entries to chosen member

#### Data Persistence


- As a user, I want to save the record of the family
- As a user, I want to load a file/data of the family


## Phase 4: Task 2

Sample:
- Add Weight log of: 123.0 to Ethan
- Add Weight log of: 123123.0 to Bryan


## Phase 4: Task 3


- currently, GUI handles list of member. I would create 
another class called Family to handle list of members
- separate GUI class to several smaller classes instead
of having one big GUI class
